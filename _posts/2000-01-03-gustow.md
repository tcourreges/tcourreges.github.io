I worked on this app in order to get familiar with [Android](https://www.android.com/), as well some [Human-computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) concepts.

It is an interactive restaurant menu, on which the guests can order their meal directly, without the assistance of staff members.

You can find the source code in my [GitHub repository]({{ page.repo }}).

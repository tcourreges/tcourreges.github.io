Help probes gather and return resource to your ship, while stopping aliens from invading, with laser-powered defense!

### Concept

The goal of this project was to get acquainted with the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine, by creating a full game, and showcasing a few different things :
- **Simple core gameplay:** the game emulates the popular [Tower defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) genre, where you stop enemies by building towers.
- **Additional elements relying on engine features:** In order to function, your towers have to be powered by a laser system, which uses [raycasting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html). This forces the player to optimize his layout, and sometimes redirect the laser, adding a puzzle game dimension to the game.
- **Polished human interaction:** The game controls are intended to be enjoyable and intuitive.
- **UI:** Menus and HUD were implemented, in order to get familiar with Unity's UI.
- **Some sort of AI:** Both the probes and aliens explore the world, and therefore need to show convincing behaviours.

### Implementation

The game was made with Unity (C#), using a few free art assets.

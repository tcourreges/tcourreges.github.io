Looking back, [JRPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games#Japanese_console_role-playing_games) have been a great source of entertainment during my childhood. In my opinion, their [random encounter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_encounter) system didn't age well, and while their turn based combat system still attracts a lot of enthusiasts, even as a stand-alone thing, it isn't really what made me love these games.

What I've been specifically missing, however, is the exploration part. I'm talking about that puzzle-like gameplay, similar to [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban), except less one-dimensional. Other great illustrations would be [Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) games, as well as [Okami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckami) (even though they're technically closer to [action RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game)).

That's what inspired me to start this project, in which I'm trying to emulate that exploration/puzzle gameplay.

<table class="img-table">
  <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span"><img src="/images/wipgame/1.jpg"></td>
      <td markdown="span"><img src="/images/wipgame/2.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For now, I've been focusing mainly on the coding aspect of the game, trying to implement as many features as I could think of.
While the **core gameplay** is pretty clear, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of **design** (designing levels, as well as making the game coherent as a whole), **art** (I'm trying to make it work with my limited skill)... and of course **finding a name**.

<table class="img-table">
  <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span"><img src="/images/wipgame/3.jpg"></td>
      <td markdown="span"><img src="/images/wipgame/4.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


I decided to create a **demonstration level**, in order to showcase what I have so far. It is very dense as I tried to fit in as many things as possible -- new gameplay elements would likely be introduced at a much slower pace in the finished game.

I used the [Unity](https://unity.com/) engine (C#) and [blender](https://www.blender.org/), and made everything myself, with the exception of the current soundtrack and character animations (which are under [CC0](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ)).

I wrote this program in C++, in order to get familiar with the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/).

Just like [Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint), it offers the basic functionalities you can expect from a graphics editor :
* drawing lines, shapes and polylines
* pen widths and colors
* selecting and moving drawn elements
* undoing changes
* saving/reloading

You can find the source code in my [GitHub repository]({{ page.repo }}).

### Concept
As it was supposed to be a [Serious Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game), the goal of this project was twofold :
* Help the player learn about the [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system)
* Still provide entertainment through meaningful gameplay

It ended up being a vertical scrolling [_shoot 'em up_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up), in which the player takes control of a **nanotechnology ship, inside of the human body**.

Just like your typical _shoot 'em up_, the ship fires missiles at enemies, but there's a twist :
* those missiles are [lymphocites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte) and [macrophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage)
* the enemies are [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) trying to harm regular cells

In order to defend those regular cells, the player must defeat the pathogens, by firing the right cells. This implies learning and understanding the different immune system interactions, that are introduced throughout the levels.

### Implementaton

The game was made in AS3, using the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) research framework _Genome_.

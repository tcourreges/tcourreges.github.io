What I like most about programming is solving problems through efficient algorithms.

[Competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), such as [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/), is a great way to have fun doing this, which is why I followed the INF280 class at Telecom ParisTech.

You can find a bunch of problem solutions (in C++) I had to submit every week at the time, in my [GitHub repository]({{ page.repo }}).

While I still enjoy competitive programming occasionally, I can't really be bothered keeping track of my solutions and uploading them anymore, but this might change eventually.
